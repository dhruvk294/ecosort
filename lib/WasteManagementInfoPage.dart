Effective waste management practices ensure that waste is handled efficiently from its inception to its final disposal, covering various stages including collection, sorting, and recycling.',

        'Why is it Important?',
        'Proper waste management reduces pollution, conserves natural resources, and ensures that waste is handled in an environmentally friendly manner. It helps maintain the balance of the ecosystem and protects wildlife. By managing waste effectively, we can prevent harmful chemicals from leaching into the soil and waterways, thereby safeguarding the health of both humans and the environment.',

        'Types of Waste',
        '1. Organic Waste: Includes kitchen waste, vegetables, flowers, leaves, and fruits. This waste is biodegradable and can be composted.\n\n'
            '2. Inorganic Waste: Includes materials like plastic, glass, and metals that do not decompose easily. These materials can often be recycled to reduce their impact on the environment.\n\n'
            '3. Hazardous Waste: Includes waste that poses a threat to public health or the environment, such as chemicals, batteries, and pesticides. These require special disposal methods to prevent harm.\n\n'

            '2. Waste-to-Energy Technologies: Modern technologies allow the conversion of waste materials into energy, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing landfill use.\n\n'
            '3. Recycling Innovations: Advances in technology have led to better sorting methods and recycling processes, making it possible to recycle more types of materials efficiently.\n\n'
